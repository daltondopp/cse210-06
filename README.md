# Minesweeper

Take a guess where it is safe to land. Choose right and more clues will help you continue safely, but choose wrong and...... BOOM! The mine will go off and the game will be over. When playing, each number on a square means that there are that number of bombs touching that square. Good Luck!


# Getting Started
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer.

Then open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Run the program from there.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the Final Project folder and click the "run" icon.
